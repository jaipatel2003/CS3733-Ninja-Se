# Ninja-Se
A small, standalone web application/game developed in JavaScript and React.js

## Game Instructions:
Ninja-se is scared! He needs to escape from a 4 x 5 room with 20 cells arranged in five rows and four columns. Ninja-se can move from one cell to another, but only to the cell up, down, left, or right from his current location. Some cells (colored BLACK) are walls and prevent movement. Some of the cells in each room contain a colored key, shown as small colored squares. There will be a corresponding locked wall for each key with matching color. If Ninja-se is in a cell with a key he can pick it up but he can only hold one key at a time, so requesting to pick up a new key will automatically drop the key he had been holding.

To escape a room, Ninja-Se must unlock all of the locked doors.
